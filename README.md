# Binary Tree Project

## Overview

This project implements basic functionalities related to binary trees in C.
It includes functions to create nodes, insert nodes as left or right children,
check if a tree is full or perfect, find the height and depth of a tree, and more.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `binary_trees.h`: Header file containing struct definitions and function prototypes.
- `0-binary_tree_node.c`: Function to create a new binary tree node.
- `1-binary_tree_insert_left.c`: Function to insert a node as the left child of another node.
- `2-binary_tree_insert_right.c`: Function to insert a node as the right child of another node.
- ...
- `14-binary_tree_balance.c`: Function to measure the balance factor of a binary tree.
- `15-binary_tree_sibling.c`: Function to find the sibling of a node.
- `16-binary_tree_uncle.c`: Function to find the uncle of a node.
- `main.c`: Example main file for testing the implemented functions.

## Functionality

This project provides the following functionalities:

- Create a binary tree node.
- Insert nodes as left or right children.
- Check if a tree is full or perfect.
- Find the height, depth, and balance factor of a binary tree.
- Find the sibling and uncle of a node
